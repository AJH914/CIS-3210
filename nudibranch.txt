Nudibranchs are a group of soft-bodied marine gastropod molluscs 
that shed their shells after their larval stage. They are noted 
for their often extraordinary colours and striking forms, and 
they have been given colourful nicknames to match, such as "clown", 
"marigold", "splendid", "dancer", "dragon", and "sea rabbit".
Currently, about 3,000 valid species of nudibranchs are known.

The word "nudibranch" comes from the Latin nudus "naked" and 
the Ancient Greek (brankhia) "gills".

Nudibranchs are often casually called sea slugs, as they are 
a family of opistobranchs (sea slugs), within the phylum Mollusca
(molluscs), but many sea slugs belong to several taxonomic groups 
that are not closely related to nudibranchs. A number of these 
other sea slugs, such as the photosynthetic Sacoglossa and the 
colourful Aglajidae, are often confused with nudibranchs.

Nudibranchs occur in seas worldwide, ranging from the Arctic, through 
temperate and tropical regions, to the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. 
They are almost entirely restricted to salt water, although a few 
species are known to inhabit lower salinities in brackish water.

Nudibranchs live at virtually all depths, from the intertidal zone 
to depths well over 700 m (2,300 ft). The greatest diversity of 
nudibranchs is seen in warm, shallow reefs, although one nudibranch 
species was discovered at a depth near 2,500 m (8,200 ft).

Nudibranchs are benthic animals, found crawling over the substrate.
The only exceptions to this are the neustonic Glaucus nudibranchs, 
which float upside down just under the ocean's surface; the pelagic 
nudibranchs Cephalopyge trematoides, which swim in the water column;
and Phylliroe bucephalum.
